1. DO record the assignment token provided on the exercise page, 
you will need it to submit your solutions. 

when submitting enter exercise number and then enter email

2. you do not need to include the ".m" portion of the script file name, so, run the Exercise 1 script by typing just "ex1" at the command line.

3. You also do not need to include parenthesis () when using the submit script. Just type "submit". 

4. The submit grader uses a different test case than what is in the PDF file. 
SimilaR TO LEETCODE, Your code must work correctly with any size of data  set.

5. So, every line of code should end with a semicolon.

6. If your code runs but gives the wrong answers, you can insert a "keyboard" command in your script
This will cause the program to exit to the debugger, so you can inspect all your variables from the command line

7. It is always a good idea to test your functions using the unit tests before submitting to the grader.

8. If you run the submit script and get a message that your identity can't be 
verified, be sure that you have logged-in using your Coursera account email 
and your Programming Assignment submission password

9.  If you get the message "submit undefined", first check that 
you are in the working directory where you extracted the files 
from the ZIP archive. Use "cd" to get there if necessary. 

10.  If the "submit undefined" error persists, or any other "function undefined" 
messages appear, try using the "addpath(pwd)" command to add your present 
working directory (pwd) to the Octave execution path. 

11. If the submit script/function crashes with an error message, please see 
the  thread "Mentor tips for submitting your work" under "All Course  
Discussions".





summary of writing the functions
note always be in directory of exercise folder in matlab drive
1. look for * beside the filenames because this will need to be completed
2. open it
3. exn.mlx will contain the code sections which call the functions inside those files
with those filenames that you will have to complete, thus testing your written function
4. those sections can be run by the click path live editor > run section
4. once a section or the whole exercise is done type the submit command in the command line
